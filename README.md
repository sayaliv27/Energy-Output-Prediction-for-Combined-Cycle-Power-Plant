# Energy-Output-Prediction-for-Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant

This project aims at predicting the energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant using data collected from a Power Plant over 5 years (2006-2011). 

The energy output is predicted to understand the relationship between the site parameters and the energy output of the power plant. 

The accurate prediction of energy of a power plant helps in reducing various issues such as power outage, cost and technical difficulties. Knowing accurate prediction of energy in advance helps in optimizing the surrounding parameters to increase the efficiency of the power plant.

Machine learning is an essential tool that enables us to handle complex data and analyze it. It allows a machine to learn from existing data and apply the knowledge to new data, thus being able to predict certain values using various methods and algorithms.

In this project, we will be using machine learning to predict the full load output power of a Combined Cycle Power Plant.
